# Blockchain

Prototype private blockchain used to tokenize equity in private investment funds.

Blockchain is constructed with a proof-of-work consensus algorithm and utilizes sha256 hashing. All nodes in the network are able to read/create blocks.

Local database is implemented using LedgerDB for testing usage. Blockchain is stored between uses and can be used for testing.

Private wallets and tokens are created and encrypted. Currently, "placeholder" tokens are utilized in test transactions but would be changed to be integrated into 
existing Blockchains such as ETH.
